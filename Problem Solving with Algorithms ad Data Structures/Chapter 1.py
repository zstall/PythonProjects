Chapter 1: Introducation

1.1: Objectives
1.2: Getting Started
1.3: What is Computer Science?
1.4: What is Programming?
1.5: Why Study Data Structures and Abstract Data Types?

notes: An ABSTRACT DATA TYPE, or ADT, is a logical description of
how we view data and the operations that are allowed without regard
to how they will be implemented. We only concern ourselves with what
the data represents and not how it will be constructed. By providing
this level of abstraction, we are ENCAPSULATING the data. This is
so we can focus on the complexity of the task at hand, and not get
lost in the details.

1.6: Why Study Algorithms?
1.7: Review of Basic Python
1.8: Getting started with Python

notes: A CLASS (In all OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING/OOP i.e. python or
java...) is the description of wha the data looks like (the state) and
what the data can do (the behavior).
Classes are analogous to abstract data types because a user of a class
only sees the state and behavior of a data item. Data items are called
OBJECTS in the OOP paradigm. An OBJECT is an instance of a class.

EX) Python classes:
    int -- Integer
    float -- Decimal
    bool -- True/False
    List -- []
    strings
    tuples
    dictoinary

1.9: Input and Output

notes: Often we will need to interact with the user, python provides us
with a easy method to ask for information from the user. The function is
called the INPUT function.

EX) aName = input("Please enter your name: ")

    print( "Your name in all capitals is", aName.upper(),
           "and has length", len(aname))
